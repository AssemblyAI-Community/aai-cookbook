# AssemblyAI Cookbook 🧑‍🍳
The AssemblyAI Cookbook shares example code for accomplishing common tasks with the AssemblyAI API.

To run these examples, you'll need an AssemblyAI account and API key ([create a free account](https://www.assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup)).

Most code examples are written in Python/Javascript, though the concepts can be applied in any language.
