# AssemblyAI Real-Time Transcription Browser Example

This open-source repo provided by AssemblyAI displays how to use our real-time API in the browser!

In this app, we grab an audio stream from the user's computer and then send that over a WebSocket to AssemblyAI for real-time transcription. Once AssemblyAI begins transcribing, we display the text in the browser. This is accomplished using Express for our backend and Vanilla JavaScript with the npm package [recordrtc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/recordrtc) for our frontend.

## How To Install and Run the Project

##### ❗Important❗

- Before running this app, you need to upgrade your AssemblyAI account. The real-time API is only available to upgraded accounts at this time.
- Running the app before upgrading will cause an **error with a 402 status code.** ⚠️
- To upgrade your account you need to add a card. You can do that in your dashboard [here](https://app.assemblyai.com/)!
