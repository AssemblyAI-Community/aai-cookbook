WEBVTT

00:04.300 --> 00:08.380
Over the next few minutes. I don't plan to change the blueprint

00:08.515 --> 00:12.150
of your life, your career, or even your tomorrow.

00:12.650 --> 00:15.650
But I do plan to challenge what you think about it,

00:15.787 --> 00:19.285
because what I've learned has changed my tomorrows,

00:19.405 --> 00:22.955
my career and my life. But before

00:23.002 --> 00:25.385
I start, I want to introduce you to someone who's here with me today.

00:25.417 --> 00:29.060
This is Uncle Harry. Oh, you can't see him. Oh,

00:29.092 --> 00:32.390
then picture this. Uncle Harry's a little shorter than me,

00:32.482 --> 00:35.650
a lot grayer. He has this bushy moustache,

00:35.725 --> 00:39.145
wears a white lab coat with a black stethoscope around his neck,

00:39.235 --> 00:42.695
and always has this unlit cigarette dangling out

00:42.697 --> 00:46.600
of his mouth. He served with distinction in the Canadian Navy

00:46.675 --> 00:50.060
in World War II and went on to become one of Montreal's most

00:50.092 --> 00:54.110
beloved pediatricians. All his little patients called

00:54.142 --> 00:57.512
him Uncle Harry. In fact, many of them still do.

00:58.175 --> 01:02.410
So I'm 19 years old, just returned from a European vacation

01:02.530 --> 01:05.840
with a gray tan, a bushy haircut and a

01:05.857 --> 01:09.515
long beard, ready to begin my major

01:09.607 --> 01:13.940
in biology at McGill University, headed towards well,

01:13.957 --> 01:17.140
I'm not sure where I'm headed, which is why I go to see Uncle Harry

01:17.170 --> 01:19.562
for advice. He being a doctor and all.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.687
But what he tells me is not what I expect.

01:24.650 --> 01:28.255
Norm, he says, think of your career

01:28.315 --> 01:30.600
as a river, and you have a choice.

01:31.700 --> 01:34.880
You can launch your boat in the water and

01:34.927 --> 01:38.312
paddle upstream towards a goal you think you want,

01:38.975 --> 01:42.410
only to find you arrive there exhausted and it isn't what you

01:42.442 --> 01:45.940
want. Or you can steer your boat

01:45.970 --> 01:49.535
downstream and find all the bends and turns which

01:49.567 --> 01:53.700
provide you opportunities you never could have imagined.

01:54.350 --> 01:58.105
That's what I did. And I've had the most incredible

01:58.165 --> 02:01.790
career. And one more thing, Norm. Whatever it

02:01.807 --> 02:05.162
is you do, make sure you come to love it.

02:06.200 --> 02:09.295
Wow. That was very serious advice.

02:09.385 --> 02:12.275
So what did I do with it? I think I did what most first year

02:12.337 --> 02:15.675
university students would do. I gathered together with my buddies

02:16.025 --> 02:20.585
and we went to see The Rocky Horror Picture Show about

02:20.617 --> 02:24.385
15 times. No, I never discussed Uncle

02:24.430 --> 02:28.112
Harry's advice with anyone for almost 40 years.

02:28.625 --> 02:32.590
But it's just a few weeks later, I'm standing

02:32.620 --> 02:35.725
in my first biology lab at McGill University.

02:35.875 --> 02:39.560
It is huge. We're in the big leagues. There are microscopes all

02:39.592 --> 02:43.115
over. I'm standing in front of one looking for a

02:43.132 --> 02:46.415
fungus, and I move my slide up

02:46.432 --> 02:49.187
and down, back and forth, and I see nothing.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.390
And I keep trying, and I'm just getting more frustrated. And I start to

02:53.407 --> 02:56.720
sweat because there's this impatient lying growing behind

02:56.797 --> 03:00.100
me. Finally, I find that fungus.

03:00.250 --> 03:04.160
At this point, I have another F word for it. And then I feel

03:04.192 --> 03:06.675
this presence behind me and this little whisper.

03:07.475 --> 03:11.485
You're never going to love this. I bend

03:11.530 --> 03:14.935
over, pick up my backpack, head down the corridor

03:14.980 --> 03:16.637
to my course advisor's office.

03:18.050 --> 03:21.665
Barbara, how do I get out of this? Well,

03:21.682 --> 03:25.270
Barbara, listens to my rant. And being the scientist she is, she keeps

03:25.285 --> 03:29.162
a very straight face and finally just asks me two questions.

03:29.750 --> 03:32.725
Norm, forget about school for a minute.

03:32.875 --> 03:36.095
What is it you like and what interests you?

03:36.247 --> 03:39.010
Oh, well, that was easy. Math,

03:39.130 --> 03:42.970
logical puzzles, argument. Barbara helps

03:42.985 --> 03:46.430
me find a law course being given the next semester to replace the lost lab

03:46.477 --> 03:50.180
credit legal problems of the poor. It's being given

03:50.227 --> 03:53.840
by a young Montreal lawyer by the name of Bob Cooper. Well,

03:53.857 --> 03:57.740
you know how it is when you really connect with a teacher. Bob and

03:57.757 --> 04:01.615
I hit it off. In fact, by the end of semester,

04:01.720 --> 04:05.180
bob has me convinced to make an application to law school.

04:05.377 --> 04:08.780
He even writes me the letter of reference that helps me get in.

04:08.977 --> 04:12.375
Bob Cooper changed the course of my river.

04:12.800 --> 04:16.015
But you want to know something else? Bob Cooper didn't

04:16.045 --> 04:19.390
love being a lawyer anymore. He told me he had this dream

04:19.420 --> 04:22.855
of becoming a film producer. He'll roll the camera

04:22.915 --> 04:26.170
forward 20 years and Bob Cooper

04:26.185 --> 04:29.765
has become the president of HBO Pictures in Los Angeles. He then

04:29.782 --> 04:33.140
goes on to work for Steven Spielberg at DreamWorks and forms his

04:33.157 --> 04:37.015
own film and television production company and becomes

04:37.045 --> 04:40.725
one of my clients, uncle Harry's River.

04:41.075 --> 04:44.540
But it was way more complicated than that. So let

04:44.557 --> 04:48.300
me start with the night that I met Pierre Elliot Trudeau.

04:48.875 --> 04:52.660
He had just shocked the country by announcing he was resigning as prime minister

04:52.780 --> 04:55.750
and was going to join a small Montreal law firm,

04:55.825 --> 04:59.320
heenan Blakey, where I happened to be working as a young lawyer.

04:59.485 --> 05:02.765
While Roy Heenan was so excited with the national news that

05:02.782 --> 05:05.945
he held a little soiree at his house for all of us to go meet

05:06.022 --> 05:09.695
Mr. Trudeau. I went, but I didn't really want

05:09.697 --> 05:13.360
to be there. I don't know about you, but I wasn't

05:13.405 --> 05:16.490
really comfortable in those kind of social environments. I'm terrible at

05:16.507 --> 05:20.390
small talk. I'll have to say something to him and he's never

05:20.407 --> 05:24.070
going to remember me anyway. So as soon as it's feasible,

05:24.235 --> 05:27.785
I make my excuses, head for the door, and who should be

05:27.817 --> 05:31.625
standing there, not that far from me with his coat on?

05:31.687 --> 05:35.135
Yep. Pierre Trudeau. Well, as we head

05:35.167 --> 05:39.365
out into the snowy cold, I get all climbed up,

05:39.532 --> 05:43.235
like I know I have to say something. And I hear these words coming

05:43.267 --> 05:45.935
out of my mouth. Can I offer you a lift home,

05:45.967 --> 05:49.520
sir? My little hatchback is

05:49.597 --> 05:52.940
parked across the street. There's a car seat in the back. I can't remember when

05:52.957 --> 05:54.737
the last time was I cleaned it up.

05:56.375 --> 05:59.540
Oh, my God. And he says yes. Like, what am I going to

05:59.557 --> 06:02.765
say? He's maybe the most famous prime minister in Canadian history and

06:02.782 --> 06:06.215
I'm nobody. When we get to the

06:06.232 --> 06:08.925
car, get in. And I have this flash.

06:09.275 --> 06:11.987
We have one thing in common.

06:13.175 --> 06:16.615
How are your children? I ask. Well, he starts

06:16.645 --> 06:20.315
to talk and he doesn't stop talking. Until we get home.

06:20.482 --> 06:22.910
I discovered that his oldest child,

06:23.017 --> 06:26.335
Justin, was just a young teenager, and he's quite disappointed

06:26.380 --> 06:29.585
in him. When I was a boy, he said it was before

06:29.617 --> 06:33.785
the days of television. I listened to radio for amusement. I read

06:33.817 --> 06:37.625
the classics. But Justin, all he's interested

06:37.687 --> 06:41.525
in is watching reruns of this film called Star

06:41.587 --> 06:45.225
Wars. And then he said the words I would never forget.

06:45.575 --> 06:48.887
I have no idea what is to become of that boy.

06:50.300 --> 06:53.860
Who can possibly judge the course of anyone's river.

06:54.055 --> 06:57.400
From Star Wars superfan to high school teacher

06:57.550 --> 07:01.310
to the luke Skywalker of Canada, that was

07:01.342 --> 07:05.475
his journey. But my boat, it was going nowhere.

07:06.125 --> 07:09.460
I felt like I was drifting. In fact, by my yearend

07:09.505 --> 07:12.965
review, my boss says to me, norm, you have a lot of

07:12.982 --> 07:16.435
potential, but there's something missing,

07:16.630 --> 07:20.390
and I just can't tell you what it is. You couldn't tell

07:20.407 --> 07:23.855
me what it was? Was he serious? How could I fix

07:23.902 --> 07:27.065
myself if I didn't know what was wrong with me?

07:27.232 --> 07:30.962
Well, I went home all depressed, and my wife, Sharon, talked to me all night.

07:31.325 --> 07:35.000
I think I was getting good at listening. And finally she said,

07:35.137 --> 07:39.040
Norm, I don't think the problem is you, but there's

07:39.070 --> 07:42.455
a problem with your approach. You need to take a little

07:42.502 --> 07:45.375
initiative. You need to take charge.

07:46.400 --> 07:49.565
Take charge? It was like she lit a

07:49.582 --> 07:53.590
flame. Okay? It was more like a match to start, but enough to illuminate

07:53.620 --> 07:57.095
Uncle Harry. He didn't say, Put your boat in the

07:57.097 --> 08:00.675
river. He said spirit.

08:01.100 --> 08:04.790
I was missing a rudder. I went back

08:04.807 --> 08:08.045
to work the next day, angry mostly at myself.

08:08.197 --> 08:11.720
I'd spent four years waiting for the work to arrive on

08:11.722 --> 08:15.370
my desk. Four years waiting for my career

08:15.460 --> 08:18.137
to happen to me. Well, no more.

08:18.800 --> 08:22.435
From that point on, I took charge of everything in my career,

08:22.630 --> 08:26.750
from what I was doing, more important to why I was doing it,

08:26.887 --> 08:30.962
and most important, to how I could distinguish myself.

08:31.775 --> 08:35.660
I found a very narrow area of Canadian tax law to specialize in

08:35.767 --> 08:39.305
the financing of movies and television shows.

08:39.502 --> 08:42.965
The industry was still fairly young, and a lot of people thought I

08:42.982 --> 08:46.112
should have my head examined, because who knew where that was going?

08:46.775 --> 08:50.250
But producers in Toronto began to take notice,

08:51.125 --> 08:55.037
and that was the interesting thing. I didn't notice change so much in me

08:55.475 --> 08:58.855
as much as in other people's reactions

08:58.915 --> 09:02.550
to me. I began to speak with a little more authority.

09:03.200 --> 09:04.875
My confidence grew.

09:06.500 --> 09:09.490
Cut to the next scene. New Year's Eve,

09:09.520 --> 09:13.210
1989. We're sitting at home. Sharon is pregnant

09:13.255 --> 09:16.765
with our fourth child. But I feel something growing

09:16.795 --> 09:20.625
in me as well, something that needs to be born

09:20.975 --> 09:24.512
immediately. And the words just come bursting out.

09:25.025 --> 09:29.090
That's it. We're moving to Toronto. That's where our

09:29.107 --> 09:33.065
future is. Well, we talked about it all night through

09:33.082 --> 09:36.320
the next day. I got ready because I had to go meet with

09:36.322 --> 09:39.875
a managing partner peanut Blakey and Peter. Blakey is this big,

09:40.012 --> 09:42.225
imposing man with a booming voice.

09:43.175 --> 09:45.212
But call. How can I help you?

09:46.700 --> 09:50.550
I was a little nervous. Okay, I was a lot nervous.

09:51.950 --> 09:55.790
But I summoned my courage. Peter, I'd like to open the

09:55.807 --> 10:00.170
Heen and Blakey office in Toronto. I took

10:00.322 --> 10:03.575
charge. Well, six months later,

10:03.637 --> 10:07.400
the baby is born. We pack up the truck. We move down the 401.

10:07.537 --> 10:11.435
Shortly after that, we have our opening party in Yorkville. And who

10:11.467 --> 10:15.140
should be there? None other than Pierre Trudeau. And we

10:15.157 --> 10:15.737
talk.

10:19.350 --> 10:23.930
So that got me to Toronto. Taking charge

10:24.065 --> 10:27.345
was the beginning, but it wasn't enough, because did I have any idea how

10:27.347 --> 10:30.735
to run an office? I had no idea, no idea

10:30.767 --> 10:34.530
how to build an organization. But I was about to learn from a

10:34.577 --> 10:37.415
very interesting, inspirational source.

10:37.595 --> 10:41.645
My son Brian is getting bullied in grade one. So we start him in karate,

10:41.810 --> 10:45.060
and I decide to join him. We walk into

10:45.092 --> 10:48.090
the dojo, and I see this sign on the wall,

10:48.257 --> 10:51.465
and it says, regardless of the number of years of

10:51.482 --> 10:55.145
practice, you will never advance without singleminded

10:55.235 --> 10:59.420
determination. Singleminded determination.

10:59.585 --> 11:03.240
I understand why it's there. So white belts like Brian and I

11:03.332 --> 11:06.762
will fight through those moments of difficulty, the pain.

11:07.425 --> 11:10.920
When we look at the black belts and we see we can never be that.

11:10.997 --> 11:14.780
We will stick with it. We will be determined.

11:14.915 --> 11:18.030
We will develop a fighting spirit. Well,

11:18.077 --> 11:21.837
spoiler alert. I stay with the karate for almost 20 years

11:22.350 --> 11:25.965
and achieve my third degree or sundown in

11:25.982 --> 11:29.495
terms of black belt. In fact, to break the tension, I wouldn't

11:29.510 --> 11:32.810
mind sparring right now. And I gathered Justin used to do some boxing,

11:32.855 --> 11:36.330
so bring it on. But he's got enough

11:36.377 --> 11:39.935
problems. Single minded determination became

11:39.980 --> 11:43.940
my mantra. It helped me get through those moments of doubt when others doubted

11:43.970 --> 11:47.390
me, when I doubted myself. Every consultant I spoke

11:47.420 --> 11:50.885
to said, there is no way your startup

11:50.930 --> 11:54.912
will ever compete with the major firms in Toronto. Not possible.

11:55.725 --> 11:58.675
And that became my marketing approach.

12:00.450 --> 12:03.245
We are the underdogs. We are determined.

12:03.335 --> 12:07.095
We will compete. Cut and fade into the

12:07.097 --> 12:10.125
next scene. It's almost 25 years later,

12:10.262 --> 12:14.090
and we have done it. We have built this glorious national

12:14.270 --> 12:17.600
firm with international dimensions. My career,

12:17.675 --> 12:20.805
as well, has blossomed. I've gone from representing small,

12:20.852 --> 12:24.105
independent producers to becoming an adviser to

12:24.152 --> 12:27.290
major Hollywood studios. I was sitting

12:27.320 --> 12:30.920
in the boardroom the day that the decision to produce The Hunger Games

12:30.935 --> 12:34.860
was made. How cool was that? In fact,

12:34.967 --> 12:38.510
it was unimaginable. And that was my ride.

12:38.555 --> 12:41.415
But there was one more thing I needed in my boat that helped me get

12:41.432 --> 12:44.655
there. And it wasn't so much something I learned as something

12:44.702 --> 12:49.065
that I had to unlearn. And that was that

12:49.232 --> 12:52.890
failure was the adversary. It's something you'll also have

12:52.907 --> 12:56.505
to unlearn. Failure is not your adversary. It is your

12:56.552 --> 12:57.400
teacher.

13:01.725 --> 13:05.495
Failure is not the boulder in the river that's

13:05.510 --> 13:09.087
going to crush you unless you let your fear of it crush you.

13:10.950 --> 13:13.790
Interesting. See, as a managing partner,

13:13.820 --> 13:16.965
I learned that one out of every four decisions I

13:16.982 --> 13:20.400
made was going to be wrong. One in four.

13:20.537 --> 13:24.290
And I wasn't so much about the successes as what I learned

13:24.320 --> 13:28.365
from the mistakes and the failures. How we

13:28.382 --> 13:31.740
adjusted, how we moved forward, how we were able to compete. So I could

13:31.757 --> 13:36.140
give you lots of examples of how I overcame fair failure

13:36.245 --> 13:39.315
and the mistakes that were made and the rejections that we suffered. But I'm only

13:39.332 --> 13:42.825
going to give you one. Seven years ago,

13:42.962 --> 13:46.375
my boat capsized. I was drowning.

13:47.625 --> 13:51.605
One year after I'd stepped down from my leadership position, the law firm

13:51.665 --> 13:54.325
that I had helped build collapsed.

13:56.700 --> 14:00.315
Boom. The shockwaves of the tsunami could

14:00.332 --> 14:03.935
be felt from coast to coast. The greatest failure

14:03.980 --> 14:07.575
in Canadian law firm history. That's the way the national media

14:07.637 --> 14:10.920
was reporting it in its final two months. I returned to a

14:10.922 --> 14:15.025
leadership position in an effort to save it. But I failed.

14:15.750 --> 14:19.640
1110 people out of work. The feeling

14:19.670 --> 14:23.050
of loss, indescribable.

14:23.850 --> 14:26.730
Have you ever lost anything near or dear to you?

14:26.927 --> 14:30.290
If you haven't, eventually you will. Because it's

14:30.320 --> 14:34.670
called life. You see, Uncle Harry's River isn't just filled with opportunities.

14:34.835 --> 14:38.400
It's got rocks and rapids, and every once in a while you miss the final

14:38.462 --> 14:42.475
turnoff before the falls. So I had a choice.

14:42.975 --> 14:47.200
I could give up, drown, disappear into retirement,

14:48.300 --> 14:51.765
or I could start over. Now, it's one thing to start when

14:51.782 --> 14:55.230
you're in your twenties, but is any different when you're in your late fifty

14:55.277 --> 14:58.062
s. I was about to find out.

14:59.250 --> 15:02.037
I found a day job, and I began to write at night.

15:03.150 --> 15:06.285
I had no intention of writing a book. I was pretty certain I could never

15:06.317 --> 15:10.700
write a book. But I needed to process my feelings, my anger.

15:10.850 --> 15:14.075
I began to write down my stories. And I wrote

15:14.225 --> 15:17.565
night after night, week after week, month after month, until I

15:17.582 --> 15:20.337
discovered I was starting to like it.

15:21.075 --> 15:23.337
I was exactly where you are right now,

15:24.900 --> 15:28.065
discovering an interest, trying to determine if it

15:28.082 --> 15:32.337
might lead to another river. There was only one problem.

15:32.700 --> 15:36.665
I didn't have sufficient skill as a writer. And that's

15:36.695 --> 15:40.325
when it hit me. Flashed to the vignettes of Barbara

15:40.400 --> 15:43.685
and Bob Cooper, Royhan and Pierre Trudeau, my wife Sharon,

15:43.730 --> 15:48.060
my partners, all the mentors along the way. I didn't do

15:48.092 --> 15:51.840
it myself the first time I needed paddlers in my

15:51.857 --> 15:54.462
boat, but where to find them?

15:55.950 --> 15:58.962
I was home alone, like so many of us are these days.

15:59.775 --> 16:03.020
I went online. I picked

16:03.035 --> 16:07.375
up books on writing by Stephen King and others. I read my favorite authors.

16:07.950 --> 16:11.240
I looked up a couple of authors online and asked if they wouldn't mind critiquing

16:11.270 --> 16:14.725
my work. I got started on my path on my river.

16:15.450 --> 16:18.930
And seven years later, once more,

16:19.127 --> 16:23.190
I am at this unimaginable point in my life.

16:23.357 --> 16:26.125
Norman Buckle, author.

16:27.825 --> 16:31.230
I stay in touch with Uncle Harry. We talk from time to time.

16:31.277 --> 16:34.812
Okay? Mostly he listens. But he was right.

16:35.250 --> 16:39.285
Success is not a ladder. It's not a straight line. It's filled with bends and

16:39.317 --> 16:43.062
turns and falling out of the boat and climbing back in.

16:43.425 --> 16:45.325
Discovering you didn't drown,

16:46.275 --> 16:49.940
you've just learned how to swim. So that's

16:49.970 --> 16:53.487
been my journey up until now. And it's been a glorious one.

16:54.300 --> 16:57.710
But it's taken guts and filled me with exhilaration.

16:57.830 --> 17:00.795
But that's been my choice. But what about you?

17:00.947 --> 17:04.845
What are you going to choose? And here are

17:04.847 --> 17:08.125
my words of advice. Launch your boat in your river.

17:08.700 --> 17:12.625
Work on developing your skills. Take charge of your decisions.

17:13.650 --> 17:17.650
Don't be afraid to make mistakes. Don't be afraid to fail.

17:19.050 --> 17:22.900
Be determined. Work through those moments of doubts.

17:23.925 --> 17:26.637
And never be ashamed to ask for help.

17:27.225 --> 17:30.935
That is how you can become the person you can't

17:30.980 --> 17:34.225
imagine. And that's for Uncle Harry.

17:34.650 --> 17:38.255
Well, once more, he's shuffling off the stage,

17:38.390 --> 17:41.840
back bent, began hanging

17:41.870 --> 17:45.740
a little lower, that cigarette still dangling out of his mouth

17:45.770 --> 17:47.037
as he leaves us.

17:48.600 --> 17:51.300
He never waves goodbye, because, really,

17:51.437 --> 17:54.765
he this speech has been

17:54.782 --> 17:58.300
dedicated to the memory of Dr. Harry Lyon Becaul,

17:59.100 --> 18:02.690
member of the Order of the British Empire, for distinguished

18:02.720 --> 18:06.255
military service. May his memory be a blessing and

18:06.302 --> 18:08.812
his legacy, his words and thank you.
